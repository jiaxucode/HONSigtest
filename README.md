# HONSigtest

**HONSigtest** is a Python project for significant dependencies with variable orders mining (**SDVOM**) method, which could capture significant dependencies with variable orders in sequential datasets. 
It provides a complete pipeline—from trajectory simulation and rule extraction to statistical significance testing — applicable to domains such as transportation flows, communication networks, and web clickstreams.

## 🧩 Key Components

### 1. **Trajectory Simulation (`simulation_test/`)**
Simulates clickstream or trajectory data using multi-order Markov chains.  
- Supports orders from 1st to 4th.  
- Generates synthetic trajectories for validation of dependencies with variable orders.  
- Based on transition probability matrices stored as `.npy` or `.pickle` files.

### 2. **Variable-Order Rule Extraction (`dependencies/`)**
Implements recursive algorithms for mining  with variable-order rules.  
- Counts co-occurrence frequencies and builds transition probability distributions.  
- Automatically extends lower-order nodes to higher orders.  
- Supports minimum support threshold (`MinSupport`) for rule pruning.

### 3. **Significance Testing (`significancetest/`)**
Performs statistical significant tests for variable-order rules.
- Computes means, variances, Z-scores, and confidence intervals (99%).  
- Identifies statistically significant dependencies beyond random fluctuations.  
- Export of results as `.csv`.
